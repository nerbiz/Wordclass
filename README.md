# Wordclass

Makes working with WordPress functionality easier and less bulky.

I created this, because I got confused with a number of WordPress functions, that either look too similar, have an unreasonable amount of parameters, or are unnecessarily difficult to work with. And I didn't want to always search for the names of hooks.

## Installation

Wordclass requires PHP 7.1 or higher, and can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require nerbiz/wordclass
```

## Usage

You can find usage examples in the [example files](https://github.com/nerbiz/wordclass/tree/master/example).
