# Wordclass

Makes working with Wordpress functionality easier and less bulky.

I created this, because I got confused with a number of Wordpress functions, that either look too similar, have an unreasonable amount of parameters, or have unrememberable or ambiguous long names. And I couldn't remember the names of hooks. Also, functions.php files tend to get long and messy sometimes, and my [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder) is tripping balls when that happens.

## Installation

Wordclass requires PHP 7.1 or higher, and can be installed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer require nerbiz/wordclass
```

## Usage

The docs are outdated, I'm planning on making a wiki for the new version 1.x. Please note that the update from version 0.x to 1.x has a ton of breaking changes, which is why it's a major release.

All classes have proper DocBlocks, so that'll have to do for for the time being.
